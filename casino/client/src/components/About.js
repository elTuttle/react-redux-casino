      <p>The cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value. Kings, queens, and jacks are each worth 10,
       and aces may be used as either 1 or 11.</p>

      <p>The object for the player is to draw cards totaling closer to 21,
      without going over, than the dealer's cards.</p>

      <p>The best total of all is a two-card 21, or a blackjack.</p>
